    <p>When I was a kid, I was often said to be a “Black Frog”. Now, my two kids are only thin but not black.</p>

<p>When I wanted my kids to eat well, <a href="/parenting/2024/06/22/my-two-kids.html">Watermelon Tan</a> said that he wanted to lose weight, while <a href="/parenting/2024/06/22/my-two-kids.html">Mango Kun</a> straightened his stomach, lifted his clothes and exposed his belly, and bulged into a ball to show you.</p>

<p>Why don’t kids like to eat? How can kids be willing to eat? What can you eat to help your kid grow up? These problems often make me worried about kids’s malnutrition, poor resistance, low growth, rickets, X/O-shaped legs… I found that worry can only increase troubles, and I have to find a way to guide and recuperate slowly.</p>

<p>The way I think is to make pancakes for the kids.</p>

<p>Take a soup bowl, add 50g of whole wheat flour, buckwheat flour, corn flour and soybean powder respectively, twist five or six circles of Himalayan powder salt, add 200g of milk powder, stir evenly, beat four native eggs, add a little honey, stir evenly again, and cover with a plate for later use. Cut a carrot, put the carrot slices into the cooking machine, take away the plate, pour the carrot dregs into the dough, and stir well again, so that the noodles are reconciled.</p>

<p>Next, you can set the pot and light a low fire. Take the best Mediterranean virgin olive oil and pour it into the pot. Don’t put too much oil, just dip it all over the bottom of the pot. When the oil temperature rises, you can pour a small pinch of dough into the pot. When the bottom of the dough is formed, you can turn it over with a spatula. When turning the surface, you need to pay attention to it. Be especially careful to shovel it from the bottom of the dough little by little with a shovel. Don’t worry. When the dough is all on the shovel, quickly turn it up and down, and then press the flat ball with a shovel. Take your time. Don’t be in a hurry. Press the flat ball evenly little by little, and let it spread out as thin as possible into a circle or love. It is crispy and easy to eat. When the bottom surface is formed again, turn it over, then flatten it and flatten it. After several times, you can take it out of the pan, pour the pancake into the plate, and just cover the whole plate. Such pancake is the best state.</p>

<p>I often give pancakes to kids like this, so I can explain how to make it in detail. The key lies not in the ingredients themselves, but in balanced nutrition: starch, protein, fat, dietary fiber and vitamins.</p>

<p>They usually can’t finish a whole pancake. I will make an appointment with them: eat half and leave the remaining half to me. In this way, I ate all the pancakes with my two kids.</p>

<p>At first, the kids will ask doubtfully, “What is the orange scum in this cake?” I smiled and said honestly, “Carrots, in addition, I also added milk powder, eggs and honey.” They all pretended to be angry and said, “Hmm~! Why did you do this? You vicious father!” I answered them happily: “For your healthy growth, I can’t hide it secretly!”</p>
