    <p>On April 11 of the Year of the Rabbit, the day when Kuiyonggen was registered was also my lunar birthday. Although it was a coincidence, it was also God’s will, which shocked me.</p>

<p>The origin of the name is the online name of my little daughter. When I went to Hong Kong, I saw the word “Kwai Chung”(“Kuiyong”) on several road signs, and the little girl was surprised. Later, I asked the origin of her network name. She just wanted to find a name that began with the letter “k” as the network name and typed it casually with the input method. She added a “gen”(which means “root”) word, so that she felt that the name was better. Suddenly, there was a feeling of “as if there was light”, so I registered the company with this name.</p>

<p>The company began to be operated by me alone. Industrial and commercial establishment and change, tax report registration, annual, quarterly and monthly tax reporting, opening of public accounts, and exchanges between government centers and banks are all my daily work. Although it is hard, I still enjoy it; although it is not profitable, I’m not anxious; although it is just starting, I’m still ambitious.</p>

<p>I have seen some stories of entrepreneurs starting a business, and I was moved by the deeds behind their success. I know that getting rich overnight is a luxury, and it is impossible to become a “unicorn”. These are not the goals of a company like me.</p>

<p>I have seen some stories of entrepreneurs starting a business, and I was moved by the deeds behind their successes. I know that getting rich overnight is a wild wish, and it is impossible to become a “unicorn”. These are not the goals of a company like mine.</p>

<p>“Let kids grow up in love!” This is the goal or mission of our company. If we don’t take this as the goal, we will never do it; on the contrary, we must spare no effort to achieve the goal. Anyone who recognizes our company’s values and strives for this goal is our company’s people, otherwise it is not.</p>

<p>In my opinion, starting a business is like occasionally entering the “Peach Blossom Land”, as Tao Yuanming remembered: “The beginning is extremely narrow, and only one person can pass through it. If you take dozens of steps again, you will suddenly be cheerful.” I used to read this article when I was in school, but I didn’t quite understand it. Now when I reach middle age, it’s my own life. The same is true for entrepreneurship. All entrepreneurs should take the same view.</p>

<p>Tao Yuanming also wrote: “Please refuse any social interactivities and travels. The world is against me. How can I ask for a return?” Under his inspiration, I also “Refuse any social interactivities and travels”, and I also felt that “The world are against me”, but I can’t put forward the kind of the problem like “How can I ask for a return?”.</p>

<p>In the past, when I was working other companies, an entrepreneur once said something to me like that “starting a business is endlessly fun”. At that time, I couldn’t fully understand this sentence. At this time, I was in the process of starting a business, and I deeply thought so. Entrepreneurship can make it easier for people to enter the “Eureka Moment”. The most famous one is probably Archimedes, who suddenly ran out when he was taking a bath and shouted, “Eureka (I found it)!” Eureka!” You can imagine how excited he was when he was the first to solve the problem that had no answer before that era.</p>

<p>I have also entered the Eureka moment, and I have also experienced that wonderful feeling. It is the feeling that drives the progress of human civilization.</p>

<p>Last year’s 39th birthday was spent as usual, and this year is the same. This is what I think. It is not easy for a person to live to the age of 40. In my opinion, 40 is just “self-rebirth” and having “memory of the past life”.</p>

<p>At the age of 40, I was born with Kuiyonggen, evidenced by poetry:</p>

<pre>
People are like rebirth in middle age.

The old friends cherish the time.

There is the friend fate of meeting by chance.,

Even if there is no news, there is a heart of kindness.

- April 22nd of the Year of the Dragon in Wuhan
