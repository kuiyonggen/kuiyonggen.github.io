Do most of us have the abilities to be good parents? No. 

I think we don't think it seriously because parenting is not as easy as we know. Why do we choose to be parents like the way our parents do? Why don't we learn parenting as we do in colleges? Why shouldn't our kids deserve a better childhood?

If parenting is a program, it may also be something to design, program, test and release.

We have "The Art of Design", "The Art of Programming", "The Art of Test" and so on. And now we need a brand new "The Art of Parenting".

That's why I created this repo and think of our kids, as a programmer and a father of two kids.
